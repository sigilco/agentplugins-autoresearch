# Backpressure checks

Create `.auto/checks.sh` to run correctness checks (tests, types, lint) after every passing benchmark. This ensures optimizations don't break things.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail
pnpm test --run
pnpm typecheck
```

## How it works

- If the file doesn't exist, everything behaves exactly as before — no changes to the loop.
- If it exists, it runs automatically after every benchmark that exits 0.
- Checks execution time does **not** affect the primary metric.
- If checks fail, the experiment is logged as `checks_failed` (same behavior as a crash — no commit, revert changes).
- The `checks_failed` status is shown separately in the dashboard so you can distinguish correctness failures from benchmark crashes.
- Checks have a separate timeout (default 300s, configurable via `checks_timeout_seconds` in `run_experiment`).
